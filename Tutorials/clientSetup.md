Configure your system for Client Development
====

Setting up your development environment varies greatly depending on what type of client application you wish to develop, we've separated the documentation so platforms are kept independent and we've broken down the steps in each platform:

- iOS
	- [Installation](iosInstallation.md)
	- [A note about Swift](swift.md)
	- [Integration](iosIntegration.md)

Once you are done installing and setting up your environment, continue with [Writing Registration and Login modules](login.md).
