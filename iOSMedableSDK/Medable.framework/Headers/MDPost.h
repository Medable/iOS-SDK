/**
 * Posts are messages that users can generate. They are associated with a source context, such as a 
 * Conversation or Account. Organizations create feed definitions through the Object administration interface.
 *
 * Posts are organized into post types and segments. A post type is the class of post, and segments are 
 * document types within the post itself. Each post type can be configured with various access permissions
 * and have multiple segments, each with its own set of custom properties. See the section on Feeds for more details.
 *
 * Each post type can also be configured to support Comments, each with their own configurable segments.
 *
 * This flexibility enables a multitude of use cases, from polls to question/answer to device data point storage.
